              Having graduated New York University Abu Dhabi with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science, 
              I went on to become a Technical Consultant at PwC Digital in Dubai. I like to code both inside 
              and outside work, and I am most comfortable in using React for front-end and Firebase for 
              back-end.
            </p>
            <p>
              I like to learn about the latest technologies and use them to solve problems.
